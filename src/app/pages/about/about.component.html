              <h3>lizt.co - checklists made easy</h3>
              <cite>community driven website for creating and sharing checklists</cite>
              <p></p>
              <p>Hello, my name is
                <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kamilpowalowski">Kamil</a>, and I've created this Open Source project to solve one of my problems.</p>
              <p>I'm a software developer, and often I have to do some repetitive task that requires fulfilling many steps and
                none of them can be omitted. For example: if you want to publish an application on App Store, you have to
                create a description, make screenshots, prepare tags, publish Privacy Policy, change server URL to production,
                etc. These are tasks that are done once or twice a year by every iOS developer. Mentioned steps are easy,
                but there is a lot to cover. If you forget about some, you will end by making another build. That took time.
                The easiest solution for this is to create a humble checklist and check it before submitting the application.</p>
              <p>This was the basic idea behind
                <strong>lizt.co</strong> website. But I made it more social. I want to share my checklists, and I think everyone
                can make something useful for others. So don't hesitate, play with
                <strong>lizt.co</strong>, publish own checklists or share them using a link.</p>
